This is my attempt to learn Gatsby and GraphQL. It changes frequently and shouldn't be used as much of anything except a proof of concept that WordPress and Gatsby integrate pretty nicely.

It started like as [Gatsby Starter Theme](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default), owes its styling  to [Alexandra Spalato's Gatsby Theme WordPress Starter](https://github.com/alexadark/gatsby-wordpress-theme-blog) and structure to [Zac Gordon's Tabor Gatsby Theme](https://github.com/zgordon/tabor-gatsby-theme) 

## Gutenberg

It's working with Gutenberg and many / most of the core blocks (notably not embeds although if you see them on my Netlify site then I've fixed them but forgotten to update this). It also works with my Gutenberg blocks.

## The final result

There is [some documentation of my process learning all this on my blog](https://tharshetests.netlify.com) which this repo powers.
